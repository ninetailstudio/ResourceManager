# Resource Manager

## Overview

The Resource Manager is a versatile and extensible component designed to handle resource loading and management in software projects. This tool provides developers with the capability to load various resource types from external files, manipulate them, and efficiently manage their lifecycles. By adhering to a well-defined interface, developers can optimize their applications by defining custom resource types and implementations.

## Key Features

- **Resource Loading**: The Resource Manager allows for the loading of a wide range of resource types from external files. This includes but is not limited to images, shaders, configuration files, and more.

- **Decoupled Resource Handling**: Resources loaded using the Resource Manager are decoupled from the application, promoting modularity and ease of integration into different parts of your software project.

- **Custom Resource Types**: Developers have the flexibility to define and create their own resource types to suit specific project requirements. This customization enables the use of tailored resource types optimized for your application.

- **Resource Manipulation**: Once loaded, resources can be manipulated, modified, or processed as needed before being utilized within the application.

- **Resource Management**: While the current implementation lacks an automated resource management class, the Resource Manager empowers developers to take control of resource management, allowing for tailored handling to suit the needs of individual projects.

## Usage

To use the Resource Manager, developers can follow these steps:

1. **Include the Resource Manager**: Integrate the Resource Manager component into your project by including its source code or library.

2. **Define Custom Resource Types**: Define custom resource types that match the specific needs of your project. These resource types can encapsulate data structures and logic unique to your application.

3. **Load Resources**: Utilize the Resource Manager to load resources from external files. This can be done using the provided interface, ensuring that resources are decoupled from your application's logic.

4. **Resource Manipulation**: Optionally, manipulate or process the loaded resources according to your application's requirements.

5. **Resource Management (Future Enhancement)**: Although not implemented in the current version, consider implementing a resource management class to automate resource handling and ensure efficient resource usage.

## Contributions and Future Development

The Resource Manager is designed to be a foundation for resource handling in various software projects. Contributions and enhancements are welcome to further extend its capabilities. Future development plans include the addition of an automated resource management class for streamlined resource handling.
Certainly, adding a section on building and integrating the Resource Manager into projects using CMake is a good idea. Here's a suggested section you can include in your project documentation:

## Building and Integration

### Prerequisites

Before integrating the Resource Manager into your project, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your development environment:

- CMake (version 3.10 or higher)
- C++ Compiler (supporting C++11 standard)

### Building the Resource Manager

To build the Resource Manager, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Resource Manager repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the root directory of the Resource Manager project.

3. Create a build directory (e.g., "build") within the project's root directory.

4. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the "build" directory.

5. Run the following CMake command to generate build files:
   
   ```
   cmake ..
   ```

6. Once CMake has generated the build files, you can build the Resource Manager using the appropriate build command for your platform (e.g., `make` on Unix-like systems or open the generated project file in an IDE on Windows).

### Integration into Your Project

To integrate the Resource Manager into your CMake-based project, follow these steps:

1. Download the built Resource Manager dynamic library or shared object file (e.g., `libResourceManager.so` on Linux or `ResourceManager.dll` on Windows) from the "bin" directory of the Resource Manager project.

2. Copy the downloaded library to a suitable location within your project directory.

3. In your project's top-level CMakeLists.txt file, add the following lines to link against the Resource Manager:

   ```cmake
   # Specify the path to the Resource Manager library
   set(RESOURCE_MANAGER_PATH "path/to/resource/manager/library")

   # Link against the Resource Manager library
   target_link_libraries(your_project_name PRIVATE ${RESOURCE_MANAGER_PATH})
   ```

   Replace `"path/to/resource/manager/library"` with the actual path to the Resource Manager library within your project.

4. Save your CMakeLists.txt file and regenerate your project files using CMake.

5. Build your project, and the Resource Manager will be integrated and ready to use.

### Usage

With the Resource Manager integrated into your project, you can now use it to load and manage various resource types as described in the project documentation.

This streamlined integration process allows you to easily incorporate the Resource Manager into your CMake-based projects, enhancing resource handling and management in your software applications.

Feel free to adjust the instructions and directory paths as needed to match your project's structure and conventions. This section will guide users on how to build and integrate the Resource Manager seamlessly into their projects.
